This repository contains the codebase for Cape AI's AWS SageMaker Techie-Friday Tutorial session.

## Part 1
Part 1 walks users through the basics of AWS SageMaker. You will:
1. Create a notebook instance
2. Prepare your data for Machine Learning
3. Train a Machine Learning model
4. Deploy the model and expose an endpoint for inference
5. Evaluate the model's performance

**Note: ** The code for Part 1 is taken from the [AWS SageMaker Getting Started tutorial](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/build-train-deploy-machine-learning-model-sagemaker/)
