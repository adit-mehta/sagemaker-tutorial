# Techie-Friday AWS SageMaker Tutorial
This repository contains the codebase for Cape AI's AWS SageMaker Techie-Friday Tutorial session.

## Part 1
Code for Part 1 is contained in \
`part-1/sagemaker_quickstart.py`

Part 1 walks users through the basics of AWS SageMaker. You will:
1. Create a notebook instance
2. Prepare your data for Machine Learning
3. Train a Machine Learning model
4. Deploy the model and expose an endpoint for inference
5. Evaluate the model's performance

**Note **: The code for Part 1 is taken from the [AWS SageMaker Getting Started tutorial](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/build-train-deploy-machine-learning-model-sagemaker/)

## Part 2
Code for Part 2 is contained in \
`part-2/hyperparameter_tuning.py`

Part 2 walks users through the process of Hyperparameter Tuning with SageMaker. You will:
1. Create a notebook instance
2. Download training data
3. Prepare your data for Machine Learning
4. Configure and launch a hyperparameter tuning job
5. Evaluate the best tuning job's performance

**Note **: The code for Part 2 is taken from the [AWS SageMaker Hyperparamter Tuning Job walkthrough](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/automatic-model-tuning-ex.html)
